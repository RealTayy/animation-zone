# Animation Zone
Animation Zone is a collection of libraries that I made to make my life easier. 

I write the code for these libraries then I release them for free for others to use/learn from/contribute to. Feel free to use them too if you want to make your life easier. Let's make the internet a prettier place.

## My Libraries
### Slice Revealer
Slice Revealer is a easy to use dependency free library that allows users to cover and uncover DOM elements with customizable animated slices.
